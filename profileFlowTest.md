# Profile Flow Implementation - Testing Guide

## What Was Implemented

### 1. User Profile Hook (`useUserProfile.ts`)
- ✅ Created a React hook that manages user profile state across the entire app
- ✅ Automatically fetches user data from Firebase on login
- ✅ Provides real-time updates when profile data changes
- ✅ Handles both Firebase Auth data and Firestore customer profile data
- ✅ Includes error handling and loading states

### 2. Updated ProfileScreen (`ProfileScreen.tsx`)
- ✅ Now uses real Firebase data instead of hardcoded "John Doe"
- ✅ Displays actual user name from registration
- ✅ Shows loading states while fetching data
- ✅ Includes error handling with retry functionality
- ✅ Updates display immediately when profile is edited

### 3. Updated HomeScreen (`HomeScreen.tsx`)
- ✅ Now shows actual logged-in user's name instead of "John Doe"
- ✅ Personalizes greetings with real user data
- ✅ Gracefully handles loading states

### 4. Updated EditProfileScreen (`EditProfileScreen.tsx`)
- ✅ Now saves changes directly to Firebase
- ✅ Updates both Firebase Auth and Firestore data
- ✅ Shows loading indicator during save operations
- ✅ Proper error handling for save failures

### 5. Enhanced FirestoreService (`FirestoreService.ts`)
- ✅ Added `createOrUpdateCustomerProfile()` method
- ✅ Added `getCustomerProfile()` method
- ✅ Proper error handling and Firebase Timestamp usage

### 6. Updated RegisterScreen (`RegisterScreen.tsx`)
- ✅ Now uses new customer profile service methods
- ✅ Stores complete user profile data properly in Firebase
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with existing registration flow

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Test Registration Flow
1. Open your React Native app
2. Navigate to Registration screen
3. Select "Customer" as user type
4. Fill in:
   - Full Name: "Test User"
   - Phone Number: "1234567890"
   - Vehicle Number: "MH12AB1234"
   - Email: "test@example.com"
   - Password: "password123"
5. Complete registration
6. **Expected Result**: User should be created in Firebase with all profile data

### Step 2: Test Login Flow
1. Login with the credentials from Step 1
2. **Expected Result**: User should be logged in successfully

### Step 3: Test HomeScreen
1. After login, check the HomeScreen
2. **Expected Result**: Should see "Hi Test!" instead of "Hi John!"
3. The greeting should use the actual name from registration

### Step 4: Test ProfileScreen
1. Navigate to Profile tab
2. **Expected Result**: 
   - Name should show "Test User"
   - Email should show "test@example.com"
   - Vehicle should show "MH12AB1234"
   - No more hardcoded "John Doe" data

### Step 5: Test Profile Editing
1. In ProfileScreen, tap "Edit Profile"
2. Change the name to "Updated Test User"
3. Change vehicle license plate to "MH34CD5678"
4. Tap "Save"
5. **Expected Result**: 
   - Loading indicator should appear
   - Success message should show
   - Return to ProfileScreen should show updated data
   - HomeScreen should now show "Hi Updated!"

### Step 6: Test Profile Persistence
1. Log out of the app
2. Log back in with the same credentials
3. **Expected Result**: 
   - HomeScreen should show "Hi Updated!"
   - ProfileScreen should show "Updated Test User"
   - All changes should be persisted

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Registration stores full name correctly
- [ ] HomeScreen displays actual user name (not "John Doe")
- [ ] ProfileScreen displays actual user data (not hardcoded values)
- [ ] Profile editing saves changes to Firebase
- [ ] Profile changes are visible across all screens
- [ ] Profile data persists after logout/login
- [ ] Error handling works when Firebase is unavailable
- [ ] Loading states are shown during data operations

## Firebase Console Verification

Check your Firebase Console:

### Firestore Collections:
1. **users** collection should contain:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "user-uid-here",
     "email": "test@example.com",
     "displayName": "Test User",
     "phoneNumber": "1234567890",
     "isActive": true,
     "createdAt": "timestamp",
     "updatedAt": "timestamp"
   }
   ```

2. **customerProfiles** collection should contain:
   ```json
   {
     "userId": "user-uid-here",
     "fullName": "Test User",
     "phoneNumber": "1234567890",
     "vehicleNumber": "MH12AB1234",
     "createdAt": "timestamp",
     "updatedAt": "timestamp"
   }
   ```

### Firebase Auth:
- User should exist with correct email
- Display name should be set to user's full name

## Troubleshooting

If issues occur:

1. **HomeScreen still shows "John Doe"**: 
   - Check if useUserProfile hook is being called
   - Verify Firebase data is being fetched correctly

2. **ProfileScreen shows loading forever**:
   - Check Firebase connection
   - Check console for error messages
   - Verify user is authenticated

3. **Profile changes not saving**:
   - Check Firebase Firestore rules
   - Verify user has write permissions
   - Check network connectivity

4. **App crashes on profile load**:
   - Check import statements for useUserProfile hook
   - Verify Firebase is initialized properly
