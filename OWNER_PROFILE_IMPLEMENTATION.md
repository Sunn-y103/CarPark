# Owner Profile Auto-Population Implementation

This implementation provides automatic population of owner details from Firebase authentication when an owner logs in to the CarPark application.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Owner Profile Service (`FirestoreService.ts`)
- Added `createOrUpdateOwnerProfile()` method to handle owner-specific data
- Added `getOwnerProfile()` method to retrieve owner profile information
- Handles business details like business name, address, license, operational settings

### 2. Owner Profile Hook (`hooks/useOwnerProfile.ts`)
- Custom React hook for managing owner profile state
- Automatically fetches owner data on authentication state changes
- Provides methods to update owner profile information
- Handles loading states and error handling

### 3. Updated Owner Screens
- **OwnerProfileScreen**: Now uses Firebase data instead of hardcoded values
- **OwnerDashboardScreen**: Displays actual owner/business name from Firebase
- Real-time profile updates with loading states
- Error handling and retry functionality

## How It Works

### 1. Owner Registration
When an owner registers through `RegisterScreen.tsx`, the system creates:
- A user profile in the `users` collection with role: 'owner'
- An owner-specific profile in the `ownerProfiles` collection with business details

### 2. Owner Login
When an owner logs in through `LoginScreen.tsx`:
- Firebase Auth authenticates the user
- The system automatically determines the user role (owner/customer)
- Owner-specific data is fetched from both `users` and `ownerProfiles` collections

### 3. Profile Auto-Population
The `useOwnerProfile` hook:
```typescript
// Automatically fetches owner data when user logs in
const { owner, isLoading, error, updateOwnerProfile } = useOwnerProfile();

// Owner data structure
interface OwnerData {
  id: string;
  ownerName: string;
  businessName: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  address: string;
  businessLicense: string;
  totalSpots: number;
  operatingHours: string;
  autoApproval: boolean;
  notifications: boolean;
  emailAlerts: boolean;
}
```

### 4. Real-time Updates
- Changes to owner profile are immediately reflected in the UI
- Data is synchronized between Firebase Auth profile and Firestore collections
- Activity tracking for profile updates

## Data Flow

```
Owner Login → Firebase Auth → Role Determination → Fetch Owner Profile → Auto-populate UI
     ↓
Firebase Auth User Data + Firestore Owner Profile → Combined Owner Data → UI Display
```

## Database Structure

### users Collection
```json
{
  "userId": {
    "email": "owner@example.com",
    "displayName": "John Doe",
    "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",
    "role": "owner",
    "isActive": true,
    "createdAt": "timestamp",
    "updatedAt": "timestamp"
  }
}
```

### ownerProfiles Collection
```json
{
  "userId": {
    "ownerName": "John Doe",
    "businessName": "Premium Parking",
    "businessAddress": "123 Business St, City, State",
    "businessPhone": "+1234567890",
    "businessLicense": "BL123456789",
    "totalSpots": 50,
    "operatingHours": "24/7",
    "autoApproval": true,
    "notifications": true,
    "emailAlerts": false,
    "createdAt": "timestamp",
    "updatedAt": "timestamp"
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Data Population**: No more "John Doe" placeholder data
2. **Real-time Updates**: Changes are immediately reflected across the app
3. **Proper Data Management**: Separation between auth data and business-specific data
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with retry functionality
5. **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during data fetching
6. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with defined interfaces

## Usage in Owner Screens

### OwnerProfileScreen
```typescript
// Before (hardcoded data)
const [profile] = useState({
  ownerName: 'John Doe',
  businessName: 'CarPark Plaza',
  // ... other hardcoded values
});

// After (Firebase data)
const { owner, isLoading, updateOwnerProfile } = useOwnerProfile();
// Owner profile is automatically populated from Firebase
```

### OwnerDashboardScreen
```typescript
// Before (hardcoded)
<Text>CarPark Business</Text>

// After (Firebase data)
<Text>
  {isLoading ? 'Loading...' : (owner?.businessName || owner?.ownerName || 'CarPark Business')}
</Text>
```

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `src/hooks/useOwnerProfile.ts` - Owner profile management hook

### Modified Files:
- `src/services/FirestoreService.ts` - Added owner profile methods
- `src/screens/owner/OwnerProfileScreen.tsx` - Firebase integration
- `src/screens/owner/OwnerDashboardScreen.tsx` - Real owner name display
- `src/components/RegisterScreen.tsx` - Fixed type issues
- `src/screens/owner/BookingRequestsScreen.tsx` - Fixed theme colors

This implementation ensures that when owners log in, their details are automatically populated throughout the owner interface, replacing all hardcoded placeholder data with real, personalized information from Firebase.
