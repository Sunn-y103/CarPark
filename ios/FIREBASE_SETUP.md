6. **App Store ID**: Leave empty for now
7. Click "Register app"

## Step 2: Download and Add GoogleService-Info.plist
1. Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file from Firebase Console
2. Copy the file to: `C:\Users\sunny\Major_CarPark\ios\CarPark\GoogleService-Info.plist`
3. **IMPORTANT**: You must also add it to Xcode project:
   - Open Xcode
   - Right-click on "CarPark" folder in project navigator
   - Select "Add Files to CarPark"
   - Choose the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file
   - Make sure "Copy items if needed" is checked

   - Click "Add"

## Step 3: Update Podfile (Already Done)
The Podfile has been updated to include Firebase pods.

## Step 4: Install Pods

```bash
cd ios
pod install
```
