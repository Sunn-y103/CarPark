# Profile Update System

## How It Works

When you edit user details in the ProfileScreen, the changes are automatically updated in the HomeScreen through a shared state management system.

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Shared State Management
Both `ProfileScreen` and `HomeScreen` use the `useUserProfile` hook, which provides:
- Shared user data state
- Shared vehicle data state
- Update functions that affect all consuming components

### 2. Update Flow
```
EditProfileScreen -> ProfileScreen -> useUserProfile -> HomeScreen
```

1. User edits profile in `EditProfileScreen`
2. `ProfileScreen.handleSaveProfile()` calls `updateUserProfile()`
3. `useUserProfile` updates both Firebase and local state
4. `HomeScreen` automatically receives updated data through the shared hook

### 3. Key Features Added

#### ProfileScreen Enhancements:
- Added explicit `refreshProfile()` call after saving
- Added loading state checks to prevent editing during load
- Disabled edit button when data is not ready

#### HomeScreen Enhancements:
- Added `useEffect` to track profile changes (with console logs)
- Automatically reflects any profile updates

#### useUserProfile Hook Enhancements:
- Enhanced state updates to clear errors
- Added debug logging for profile updates
- Improved error handling

### 4. Testing the Feature

1. Launch the app and navigate to the Profile tab
2. Click "Edit Profile" 
3. Change the name, email, phone, or vehicle information
4. Save the changes
5. Navigate back to Home tab
6. Verify that the welcome message shows the updated name: "Hi [New Name]! ðŸ‘‹"

### 5. Debug Information

The system now includes console logs to help track data flow:
- `useUserProfile: Profile updated successfully:` - Logged when hook updates data
- `HomeScreen: User profile updated:` - Logged when HomeScreen receives updates

### 6. Error Handling

- Profile updates are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Loading states prevent premature editing
- Error messages are shown to users if updates fail
- Automatic retry mechanisms for failed loads

## Verification

To verify the system is working:
1. Check browser/metro console for debug logs during profile updates
2. Observe the HomeScreen greeting change after profile edits
3. Test with various fields (name, email, phone, vehicles)
4. Test error scenarios (network issues, invalid data)

The profile update system ensures data consistency across all screens that consume user profile information.
